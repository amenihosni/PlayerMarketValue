# Player Market Value Prediction

📊 **A project for predicting football player market value based on various performance metrics and other features using machine learning.**

## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the market value of a football player. The model is built using the **RandomForestRegressor** algorithm and follows a data-driven approach to understand and predict player values from different features like performance metrics, contract details, and more.

## Steps to Reproduce

### 1. **Data Understanding**  
📋  
   - The dataset contains various features like performance statistics, player age, contract details, team information, etc.
   - Features include: Player Name, Age, Team, Market Value, Goals, Assists, Passes, Minutes Played, and more.
   - Begin by loading the dataset and exploring it to understand the underlying structure.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**  
🔄  
   - **Handle Missing Values**:  
     - Impute missing values using the mean or median for continuous variables.
     - Impute missing categorical values using the mode.
   - **Handle Outliers**:  
     - Use techniques like **Z-Score** or **IQR** to detect and remove outliers to prevent skewed predictions.

### 3. **Handling Null Variables**  
⚠️  
   - Check for missing or null values.
   - Handle them by imputation or dropping rows/columns with excessive nulls.
   - Use functions like `isnull()` and `dropna()` for quick checks and removal.

### 4. **Correlation Matrix & De-correlation**  
📊  
   - Calculate the correlation matrix using `corr()` to identify highly correlated features.
   - Visualize correlations using a heatmap for easier interpretation.
   - De-correlate features by removing one of the highly correlated columns if needed to reduce multicollinearity.

### 5. **Feature Selection**  
📈  
   - Select important features using techniques like **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** or **Feature Importance** from models like **Random Forest**.
   - Use domain knowledge to select relevant features that might influence market value.

### 6. **Data Splitting**  
➗  
   - Split the dataset into **80% training** and **20% testing** sets.
   - Use `train_test_split()` to ensure that the training and testing data are representative of the whole dataset.

### 7. **RandomForestRegressor Model**  
🌲  
   - Fit a **RandomForestRegressor** model on the training data.
   - Tune hyperparameters like **n_estimators**, **max_depth**, and **min_samples_split** using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

### 8. **Model Evaluation**
